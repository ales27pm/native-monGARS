echo "1. üìù **TypeScript/Node.js Issues:**"
echo "   - Missing dependencies in package.json"
echo "   - TypeScript compilation errors"
echo "   - Node.js version compatibility"
echo "   - ESLint configuration issues"

echo "2. üì± **iOS Build Issues:**"
echo "   - macOS runner not available"
echo "   - Xcode version incompatibility" 
echo "   - CocoaPods installation failure"
echo "   - iOS project configuration errors"
echo ""

echo "3. üêç **Python/Core ML Issues:**"
echo "   - Python package installation failures"
echo "   - Core ML tools version conflicts"
echo "   - Missing system dependencies"
echo "   - Model validation script errors"
echo ""

echo "4. üîê **Authentication/Permission Issues:**"
echo "   - GitHub token permissions"
echo "   - Repository access rights"
echo "   - Workflow file syntax errors"
echo "   - Runner environment limitations"

echo "üõ†Ô∏è **Recommended Debug Actions:**"
echo "================================"
echo ""

echo "1. **Check GitHub Actions Tab:**"
echo "   https://github.com/$GITHUB_ACCOUNT/$GITHUB_REPO/actions"
echo "   - Click on failed workflow runs"
echo "   - Expand failed job steps"
echo "   - Read error messages in logs"
echo ""

echo "2. **Review Workflow Files:**"
echo "   - Check .github/workflows/*.yml syntax"
echo "   - Verify runner compatibility (ubuntu-latest, macos-14)"
echo "   - Check dependency versions"
echo ""

echo "3. **Local Testing:**"
echo "   - Run 'bun run type-check' locally"
echo "   - Run 'bun run lint' locally"
echo "   - Test iOS build if on Mac"
echo ""

echo "4. **Quick Fixes to Try:**"
echo "   - Update Node.js version in workflows"
echo "   - Simplify dependency installation"
echo "   - Remove iOS-specific jobs temporarily"
echo "   - Use more stable package versions"
echo ""

echo "üéØ **Next Steps:**"
echo "================="
echo ""
echo "1. Visit the GitHub Actions page to see detailed error logs"
echo "2. Focus on the first failing step in each job"  
echo "3. Fix issues one workflow at a time"
echo "4. Test fixes with small commits"
echo "5. Monitor improved success rates"

echo "Most workflow failures on first deployment are due to:"

echo "- Missing system dependencies"
echo "- Runner compatibility issues"
